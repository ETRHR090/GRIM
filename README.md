# GRIM 
'GRIM' Is just a little project i've started developing to expand my knowledge of the coding language 'C++' (What 'GRIM' is coded in) and has taken many hours of many days.
Which is the reason I politely ask you not to steal it. Although, the licence will give you the right to edit copy and distrobute GRIM, it will not allow you to plagorize GRIM.
So thank you very much.
Now we have all of the boring stuff out of the way, we can talk about GRIM's features.
GRIM runs in a windows terminal and was codded in c++.
